# Fullstack Workshop offered by EdF
Repository with all the codes made during the fullstack workshop offered by [Engenharia do Futuro](https://engenhariadofuturo.com.br).

My version of this simple project is based on an online used sales store, from which I was able to learn a lot of front-end and back-end development concepts.
